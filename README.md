# LAMMPS-PIMDB

Source code for PIMD for bosons within LAMMPS. (fix_pimdb.cpp and fix_pimdb.h).
Input files for all simulations at bhw=6. For other temperatures, simply change the Temp variable accordingly.
Raw data for arXiv:1905.09053 ('.dat' pickle files) is also given with python scripts to generate figures.
I thank P. Mujal for the raw data from Physical Review A 96, 043614 (2017) (not given here).
